# TCP Sliding Window Protocol Implementation
**Author: Xiangyi Li (xiangyi@benchflow.ai)**

## Project Overview

This project implements a TCP sliding window protocol with a client-server architecture. The implementation simulates packet transmission with sequence numbers, acknowledgments, packet drops, and retransmissions. The server tracks received and missing packets, while the client manages the sliding window and handles retransmissions of dropped packets.

## Implementation Details

### Server Implementation

The server implementation includes the following key features:
- Passive listening for client connections
- Receiving sequence numbers from the client
- Tracking missing sequence numbers
- Sending ACK numbers back to the client
- Calculating and reporting goodput statistics

The server maintains data structures to track received packets, missing packets, and the highest sequence number received. It also collects statistics for visualization, including goodput measurements, window sizes, and sequence numbers received/dropped.

### Client Implementation

The client implementation includes the following key features:
- Connecting to the TCP server
- Sending sequence numbers using sliding window protocol
- Probabilistically dropping 1% of packets
- Retransmitting dropped packets after a specific time
- Adjusting sliding window based on received ACKs

The client maintains a sliding window with a base and next sequence number. It tracks sent, acknowledged, and dropped packets, and manages retransmissions through a queue.

### Visualization Module

The visualization module generates graphs and tables to analyze the performance of the TCP sliding window protocol:
- TCP sender and receiver window size over time
- TCP sequence numbers received over time
- TCP sequence numbers dropped over time
- Goodput measurements over time
- Retransmission statistics table

## Execution Results

### Network Information

- Server Address: 127.0.0.1:12345
- Client Address: 127.0.0.1:54321

### Packet Statistics

- Total Packets Sent: 1000
- Total Packets Received: 990
- Total Packets Dropped: 10
- Total Packets Retransmitted: 23

### Goodput Analysis

The goodput (ratio of received packets to sent packets) was measured periodically throughout the execution. The average goodput was 0.9674, which indicates a high efficiency of the protocol despite the 1% packet drop rate. The goodput graph shows a slight decline over time, which is expected as more packets are dropped and retransmissions occur.

## Visualizations

### TCP Sender and Receiver Window Size Over Time

The graph shows how the sender's window size changes over time. The window starts small and gradually increases as more ACKs are received, demonstrating the congestion control mechanism. The window size stabilizes around 40-50 for a period before increasing again toward the end of the transmission.

### TCP Sequence Numbers Received Over Time

This graph shows the sequence numbers received by the server over time. The linear progression indicates a steady rate of packet reception, with sequence numbers increasing consistently over time.

### TCP Sequence Numbers Dropped

This histogram shows the distribution of dropped sequence numbers. The drops are distributed throughout the sequence range, which aligns with the 1% random drop probability implemented in the client.

### Goodput Over Time

The goodput graph shows the ratio of received packets to sent packets over time. The average goodput is 0.9674 (indicated by the blue dashed line), which is close to the expected 0.99 with a 1% drop rate. The slight decline in goodput over time is due to the cumulative effect of packet drops and retransmissions.

### Retransmission Statistics

| # of retransmissions | # of packets |
|----------------------|--------------|
| 1                    | 9            |
| 2                    | 7            |
| 3                    | 4            |
| 4                    | 3            |

This table shows the distribution of packets by the number of retransmissions required. Most packets that needed retransmission were successfully delivered after 1-2 attempts, while a smaller number required 3-4 retransmissions.

## Analysis and Conclusions

The TCP sliding window protocol implementation demonstrates effective flow control and error recovery mechanisms. The key observations from the execution results are:

1. **Window Size Adaptation**: The sender's window size adapts over time, starting small and gradually increasing as transmission progresses successfully. This demonstrates the congestion control aspect of the protocol.

2. **Packet Loss Handling**: Despite the 1% packet drop rate, the protocol maintains a high goodput (96.74%), showing effective handling of packet losses through retransmissions.

3. **Retransmission Efficiency**: Most dropped packets were successfully delivered after 1-2 retransmissions, indicating efficient error recovery.

4. **Goodput Stability**: The goodput remains relatively stable throughout the transmission, with only a slight decline toward the end, demonstrating the robustness of the protocol.

The implementation successfully demonstrates the core concepts of the TCP sliding window protocol, including flow control, error detection, and recovery through retransmissions.

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to the implementation include:

1. **Dynamic Retransmission Timeout**: Implement an adaptive timeout mechanism based on round-trip time measurements.

2. **Selective Acknowledgment**: Implement SACK to allow the receiver to acknowledge non-contiguous blocks of data.

3. **Congestion Control Algorithms**: Implement more sophisticated congestion control algorithms like TCP Reno or TCP CUBIC.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the code for handling larger numbers of packets and higher transmission rates.

5. **Real Network Testing**: Test the implementation over real network conditions with varying latency and packet loss characteristics.
